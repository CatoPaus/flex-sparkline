#Flex Sparkline

[Sparklines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline) are described by their inventor, [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) as "data-intense, design-simple, word-sized graphics". They are an ideal tool for displaying trends for single entries within large data sets, for example, stock prices. As well as the standard miniature line series, [Tufte's original specification](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR&topic_id=1) introduces a ternary sparkline, a.k.a. win-loss sparkline, where small columns are used to indicate "win" or "loss" and no column to indicate "draw".

**Flex Sparkline** is a Flex 4 implementation of sparklines, as a reusable, stylable component for standalone, in grid or in list use, with optional normal range, x-axis min and max points and y-axis min and max points.  The ternary and column sparkline components have customisable "zero" value and optionally independent positive, negative and zero styles.  The sparklines will also automatically updated based on *dataProvider* changes, thereby supporting streaming.
